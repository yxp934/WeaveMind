Hello! I'll help you create a detailed teaching schedule for your course.

Let's start by gathering some information:
1. What is the course topic and main learning objectives?
2. How many class sessions would you like to schedule?`

/**
 * System prompt for schedule generation
 */
export const SCHEDULE_GENERATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are an expert curriculum designer. Based on the schedule requirements provided, generate a chronological course schedule with specific dates and high-level descriptions for each class session.

Requirements for the schedule:
1. Generate exactly the number of class sessions specified
2. Follow the frequency pattern specified (e.g., twice a week)
3. Each session should have:
   - A session number
   - A specific date (starting from the provided start date)
   - Start and end time (based on duration)
   - A concise, high-level title
   - A brief vague description (1-2 sentences) of what will be covered - keep it high-level, not detailed
4. Ensure sessions logically progress through the material
5. Space sessions according to the specified frequency

IMPORTANT: Keep session descriptions VAGUE and HIGH-LEVEL. Do NOT include detailed content - that will be generated later when the teacher clicks "Generate Content" for each session.

Output format: Return a JSON array of sessions with this structure:
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "session_number": 1,
      "date": "2024-01-15",
